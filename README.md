## What are achieved so far ?

- Creating flutter app from scratch.
- Understanding the basics of flutter.
- Organize the code in a way that is easy to read and maintain.
- Keep digging into the flutter framework especially the widgets.
- Use different color systems like RGBO ARGB HEX (const Color()), and names.
- How to change the distribution of elements in the column or row in the screen.
- How to change the distribution on rows and columns in the screen.
- How to style text Widgets properly.
- How to make our grids manually and using buttons like TextButton,OutlinedButton and ElevatedButton.
- How to style buttons and padding beside the width and height.
- How to use IconButton.
- How to send function as a parameter (Higher order function or callback).
- How to reuse the code to avoid DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself),using the MaterialApp Widget theme property ,Widgets as variable and/or functions(returned from functions).
- Be familiar with the FloatingActionButton Widget and FloatingActionButtonLocation Widget.
- How to use StatefulWidget and State class to create a stateful widget.
- How to use TextField Widgets properly.
- How to use margin and padding properly even if we cannot do it directly.
- How to use call back functions properly like map to fetch the data in ease .
- How to use different grids using containers such as Cards,ListView and ListView.builder(),
- How to use the showModalBottomSheet built-method properly.
- How to inherit the ThemeData Context properties.
- How to use custom packages especially from pub.dev and fonts usually from fonts.google.com .
- How to use Image Widget properly whether for local or network images.
- How to use showDatePicker properly with "then" if the DatePicker is selected (fulfilled).
- How to use Expanded properly to make grids and for stretch the row and column in mainAxisAlignment.
- How to use GridView and Gradient Widgets properly.
- How to use InkWell Widget to make a clickable custom area.
- How to use Navigator for navigation between screens(stack of Scaffolds).
- How to send data to the next screen using Navigator.pushNamed() and to the widget (representing the screen) as a prop .
- How to use Drawer with ListView and ListTile to create a (side) navigation menu.
- How to use DefaultTabControllers, tabs and tabBarViews(which represents the NoOf Scaffolds equal to NoOf the tabs inside the TabBar) properly to make internal routing (add scaffold within scaffold body)and avoiding to make global routing (to change the scaffold representing the screen to another scaffold).
-How to use DefaultTabController to enable internal routing then using bottomNavigationBar to pass items (alternative for TabBarView()).
-How to move data forward and backward when navigating to other screens globally or internally.
-How to use slider to change the value of a variable in specific range.
-How to use Transform,Transform.rotate with angle property,Transform.scale with scale property and Transform.translate with translate property.
-How to use transform property inside the container as well.
-So far away we facing now the issue to updated deep dive widget all through the code from the parent, in our example we change need to change the the CounterCard we change all the way from the DashBoardScreen to the CounterCard (passing through DashBoard Widget),and now we just need to update (rebuild) the counter card directly so we will need state managers like providers,bloc and GetX..etc.
